**Objective**:
The goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors using K-Means clustering. By grouping customers based on similar features such as age, income, and spending scores, businesses can better understand customer profiles, target marketing strategies, and personalize services to improve customer retention.

**Problem**:
Retailers and service providers often face challenges in understanding their customer base. Without proper segmentation, marketing and sales strategies can be generalized, leading to inefficiencies. By clustering customers, businesses can create more targeted strategies that improve customer engagement and satisfaction, leading to higher sales and retention rates.
